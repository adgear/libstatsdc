About
=====

  libstatsdc is a C client library to the etsy/statsd statistics daemon.

  For more info, see :

    * https://github.com/etsy/statsd


Installation instructions
=========================

  Run `make` to build and `make install` to install.

  `make install` will install to `/usr/local/` by default. If your C compiler
  does not search `/usr/local/include` for header files, then you might need to
  tell it to.

  To install elsewhere instead, use `PREFIX`, e. g. `make PREFIX=/usr install`.

  Arch Linux users should prefer to install with `pacman` using the PKGBUILD in
  [archgear](https://github.com/adgear/archgear/tree/master/libstatsdc).


Usage
=====

  Interface documented in libstatsdc/statsdc.h

  See the accompanying src/example.c file for example usage


Notes
=====

  1. While UDP is fire-and-forget, this library may block on DNS operations in
  statsdc_reconnect

    If you'd like guaranteed non-blocking behavior, ensure:

    * Supply the host as an IP address string, which would not require DNS
      resolution
    * Guarantee fast DNS operations by your OS (via /etc/hosts for example)
      or via upstream DNS servers and/or caching proxies

  2. If supplying sample_rate != 1, rand() will internally be called.  However
     srand() will not be called.  You should srand() once early on in your
     application to properly seed the PRNG.
